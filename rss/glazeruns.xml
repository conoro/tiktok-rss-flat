      <title>They look great! Proof that foot care isn't just important in ultrarunning—it's EVERYTHING. Remember I am not sponsored.  Healthy feet carried me all the way through the Arizona Monster 300 to the FINISH LINE! My formula for success: • Strategic shoe rota</title>

      <title>Pulled off the win although I had to really work for it. 100 miles/161 km does not come easily. Especially when the race starts at 6pm. Born to Run 100 miler was an incredible experience and I will be back. #runtok #ultramarathon #ultrarunner #borntorun </title>
