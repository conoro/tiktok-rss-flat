    <content>Little Carron Mountain (440m) offers stunning views of the Ballyhoura Country. Maybe you’ll be mesmerised by the windmills, or be captivated by drifting clouds, or even catch a beautiful sunset. The summit is just a short detour from the Castlepook mountain biking route (54km) and is also part of the Ballyhoura Way. For day-hikers, a great option is to start from the Ballinaboola car-park and hike to the summit. Make sure to add this peak to your list the next time you’re out in the Ballyhouras! #Ballyhoura #VisitBallyhoura #BallyhouraMoments #BallyhouraMountains #MunsterVales #IrelandsHiddenHeartlands #LimerickEdgeEmbrace #DiscoverIreland #KeepDiscovering #GetOutdoors #AdventureTourism #Irelandtravel #ballyhouraforest #coillteoutdoors @Munster Vales @Ireland’s Hidden Heartlands @Discover Ireland @Limerick.ie @Tourism Ireland </content>
